# Environments API

The Environments API allows you to manage deployment environments for the feature flag system. Environments represent deployment targets (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`) where feature flags can have different configurations.

## Overview

Environments are core entities in the feature flag system that define where feature flags are evaluated. Each environment has a unique programmatic `key` (used by SDKs) and a human-readable `name`.

**Base URL:** `/environments`

---

## Authentication

All endpoints require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

Requests without a valid token will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

---

## Authorization

All Environment API endpoints require the **ADMIN** role. Users without this role will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

---

### Common Error Codes

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `400 Bad Request` | Validation error or business rule violation |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid JWT token |
| `403 Forbidden` | User lacks required ADMIN role |
| `405 Method Not Allowed` | HTTP method not supported for endpoint |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Unexpected server error |

---

## Business Rules

### Soft Delete

Environments are **soft deleted** rather than permanently removed from the database:

- When deleted, `isActive` is set to `false`
- Soft-deleted environments are excluded from all API responses
- This preserves referential integrity with feature flags that reference the environment
- There is no restore functionality; once deleted, an environment cannot be recovered via the API

### Key Immutability

The `key` field **cannot be changed** after creation:

- This ensures SDK integrations remain stable
- Update requests that include `key` will ignore the field
- To change a key, create a new environment and migrate configurations

### Key Uniqueness

The `key` must be unique **among active environments only**:

- Creating an environment with a key that exists on an active environment will fail
- If an environment was soft-deleted, its key can be reused for a new environment
- This allows recovery scenarios where a deleted environment's key needs to be recreated

### Audit Trail

All environments automatically track:

- `createdAt`: Timestamp when the environment was created
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp of the last modification
- `createdBy`: User who created the environment (stored internally)
- `updatedBy`: User who last modified the environment (stored internally)
